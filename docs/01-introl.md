# Introduction

*libsodium-jna* is a java library that binds to [libsodium](https://libsodium.org) C crypto APIs with [Java   Native Access](https://github.com/java-native-access/jna) (JNA). I wrote it because I did not like any of the Java implementation of libsodium. I hope you will find this project useful and fun to use.

Bug reports, suggestions are always welcome!

If you add support to more libsodium APIs, please send me a pull request. If yo do so, please do not forget   to update the documentation add unit tests. If you need to generate test vectors, please look at ```misc/     gen_test_vectors.c```
